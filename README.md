🎯 100 Days of Code – C Programming

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code (C Programming) challenge!
This repository documents my journey of learning, practicing, and mastering the fundamentals and advanced concepts of the C language through consistent daily coding.

📌 About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Code challenge is a commitment to code for at least one hour every day for 100 days.
My focus for this challenge is:

Strengthening C programming fundamentals

Building problem-solving skills

Implementing data structures and algorithms

Working on small and large C-based projects

Writing clean, modular, and well-commented code
